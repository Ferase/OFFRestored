# Audio File List

This is a set of tables containing the names of all music and sound effects in OFF for anyone to use as reference if making a sound mod.

-------------------------------------

## General Info

All audio must be in **WAV** format. OGG support *might* be added in the future, however the version of FMod bundled with Unity 6000.1.17 does not support Vorbis, which would mean other binaries would be required to process them.

No asset etraction or injection is required for creating a sound mod with OFF Restored. Just place your audio into the correct folder with the file name that corresponds to what you would like to replace.

OFF's audio sources are loud, especially for music. refer to the below sections for best target amplitudes.

## Music

For best results, ensure your music has a maximum ampitude of no more than **-21 dB**.

All music used in the game can be found within the asset bundle file located at `OFF/OFF_Data/StreamingAssets/aa/StandaloneWindows64/music_assets_all.bundle`.

Always place replacement music in the `OFF/BepInEx/plugins/OFFRestored/Music` folder.
